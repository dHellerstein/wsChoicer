wsChoicer ver 1.85: a php/javascript app for helping small groups chose alternatives

What is wsChoicer?

  wsChoicer is designed to help small groups collaboratively choose from a mid-size set of suggestions.
  Each "user" (or member) of the group can add/rate/rank/recommend suggestions -- using their own stated preferences
  and those of other members.

How does it work?

   Using a several step process, that may take several days (or weeks) to unfold!

  1) Adding suggestions
     During this phase, members can add a suggestion. Several variables (as specified by the admin) can
     be entered for each suggestion. For example, a "publication year", a "cost", a "short description", etc.
  2) Rates, categories, notes
     During (or after) the adding suggestions phase members can rate the current suggestions.
     A 1 to 4 scale is used, with 4 being better than 1.
     Each member can also assign a category to each suggestion -- and share this categorization with other members.
     And -- members  can provide links to information, or enter longer descriptive notes.
  3) Ranking
     After suggestions have been collected, each member can rank the suggestions.
     wsChoicer uses a simple ranking system: suggestions can be assigned to a "Top 9" or a "Next best 9".
     All other suggestions are worse than next best 9!
     This ranking may be based on personal rating, or on average (across all members) rating. But it does not have to be.

  4) Recommendation
  	Once enough  members have ranked the suggestions, each member can you choose which ones to recommend.
  	Recommendations can be based on ratings, recommendations, notes, and categories. But they do not have to be.

  5) A member can use their (or another member's) recommendations to create a schedule
     Several types of schedules are supported: a hourly schedule, a calendar schedule, a quantity schecule,
     or an 'ordered by type' schedule.
     The order (such as the time in day) of a schedule can be readily changed and tweaked.

  Why these several steps? ... to use triaging to reduce how many suggestions one needs to consider!

wsChoicer has a lot of options to help members puruse, compare, and otherwise think about the suggestions.
